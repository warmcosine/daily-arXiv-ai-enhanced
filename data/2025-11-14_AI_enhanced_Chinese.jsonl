Recent results have verified that a graphical structure provides the most expressive and structurally faithful formalism for representing the relational semantics in most information sources. However, most existing works represent the semantics based on pairwise relation-based graphs, which cannot capture the higher-order interactions that are essential for some semantic sources. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian hypergraph inference-based semantic communication framework that can directly recover implicit semantic information involving high-order hyperedges at the receiver based on the pairwise relation-based explicit semantics sent by the transmitter.

In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling.

However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection. Numerical results demonstrate significant SNR improvement achieved by the proposed rotatable IRS design over various benchmark schemes under different system setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6c\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u9762(IRS)\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574IRS\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u5185\u6240\u6709\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4(SNR)\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316(PSO)\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cIRS\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u5411\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u65f6\u6539\u53d8\u5143\u7d20\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cIRS\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0IRS\u5143\u7d20\u63a5\u6536\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8ePSO\u7684SNR\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5c42PSO\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cIRS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u6bd4\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684SNR\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cIRS\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Many indoor settings, however, include naturally occurring specular surfaces such as glass, glossy metal panels, and signage, that reflect both light and mmWave signals. Exploiting this dual reflectivity, we propose See and Beam, a low-cost framework that combines LiDAR sensing with passive specular reflectors to enhance mmWave connectivity under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. In this paper, as a proof of concept, we deploy three types of reflectors, glossy, smooth, and matte (non-specular), to evaluate joint LiDAR/mmWave reflection in an indoor scenario. We demonstrate that using LiDAR-mmWave co-reflective surfaces enables a co-located LiDAR sensor to map the NLoS environment, localize NLoS users, and identify viable communication reflection points. Experimental results at 60 GHz show that LiDAR-guided beam steering with co-reflective surfaces improves the minimum received signal strength by over 20 dB in deep NLoS regions. Moreover, LiDAR-derived angle-of-departure steering achieves performance comparable to exhaustive NLoS beam search. This low cost, and scalable framework serves as an effective alternative to configurable reflecting surfaces and enables robust mmWave connectivity in future 6G and beyond networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3VLSI\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u9762\u79ef\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u548c\u5b8f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5e03\u5c40\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5e03\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLSI\u5e03\u5c40\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u800c\u5feb\u901f\u70b9\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5355\u5143\u9762\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u5efa\u6a21\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u9762\u79ef\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u865a\u62df\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8d1f\u6743\u91cd\u8fb9\u5c06\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5355\u5143\u9762\u79ef\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\uff1b2. \u5b8f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5e03\u5c40\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a\u9010\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u9762\u79ef\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7ec6\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u9762\u79ef\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c11\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7684HPWL\u76f8\u6bd4\u70b9\u57fa\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u51cf\u5c112.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5668\u5feb\u7ea6100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLSI\u5e03\u5c40\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e03\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
