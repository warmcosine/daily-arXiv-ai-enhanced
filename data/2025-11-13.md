Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统性评估方法，用于分析和量化基于修复的说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题，建立了更可靠的基准测试框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的说话人脸生成方法在保持视频细节的同时仅修改嘴唇运动，但存在嘴唇泄漏问题——生成的嘴唇受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，传统指标难以检测这种泄漏。

Method: 设计了三种互补测试设置：无声输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对、匹配的音频-视频合成；引入了嘴唇同步差异和基于无声音频的嘴唇同步分数等衍生指标；还研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响。

Result: 建立了一个模型无关的系统性评估框架，能够有效检测和量化嘴唇泄漏问题。

Conclusion: 该研究方法为解决说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题提供了可靠的基准测试方法，对未来研究具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)
*Kosta Dakic,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Rodrigo N. Calheiros,Teng Joon Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决多无人机动态追踪中的遮挡和视角变化问题，在复杂环境中保持约90%的追踪准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多无人机监控系统在动态相机位置和复杂遮挡环境下表现不佳，需要新的数据集和方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8架无人机同步拍摄）和深度学习框架，包含实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图多视角特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%检测追踪准确率，80%轨迹成功追踪；迁移学习显示强泛化能力；相机失效实验显示性能优雅下降。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，在复杂环境中表现稳健，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过粗略的运动参考动画实现精确的运动和外观控制，适用于任何基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成系统。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像和文本条件的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要特定模型微调的方法计算成本高且限制性强。

Method: 利用用户友好的操作生成粗略参考动画作为运动线索，采用双时钟去噪策略在指定运动区域强制对齐并在其他区域保持灵活性，保持外观通过图像条件控制。

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实性和运动控制方面达到或超过现有需要训练的基准方法，并能实现像素级的精确外观控制。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级的采样过程修改，无需额外训练成本，在保持自然动态的同时实现了对用户意图的高度忠实。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [5] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，所有任务共享统一内存库，通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，解决了现有方法需要为每个任务构建特定内存库导致的灵活性和可扩展性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类的内存库，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。本文旨在解决这一限制，使所有任务能够共享统一的内存资源。

Method: 提出使用统一内存库的CAD框架，训练阶段通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，实现连续任务的知识获取；推理阶段采用最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上，图像级AUROC分别达到0.972和0.891，优于现有基线方法。在真实电子纸数据集上实现了100%的异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一内存库设计有效提升了持续异常检测的性能和实用性，在多个数据集上证明了其优越性，具有实际应用价值。代码将在GitHub开源。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [6] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)
*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个融合扩散降噪和时间感知actor-critic模型的统一框架，用于解决自动驾驶中传感器噪声和及时可靠预测的挑战，实现在噪声环境下早期事故预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶事故预测面临两大挑战：(1) 天气、运动模糊或硬件限制导致的传感器输入噪声或退化；(2) 需要在早期预警和误报抑制之间平衡，实现及时可靠的预测。

Method: 提出统一框架：扩散模块通过迭代重构生成抗噪声的图像和物体特征；actor-critic架构利用长时间维度时序推理和时间加权奖励来确定最佳预警时机。

Result: 在三个基准数据集(DAD、CCD、A3D)上取得最先进精度，平均事故时间显著提升，在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类判断一致的事故预测，展现了在现实安全关键场景中的部署潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [7] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net)，一个用于动态场景图生成的模块化框架，通过评估对象对的上下文重要性来解决现有方法在推理时难以识别有意义关系的问題。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态场景图生成方法仅在有标注的对象对上训练，缺乏对非相关对象对的指导，导致推理时难以识别有意义的对象关系。

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文令牌）和时间编码器，通过评估空间交互和长期时间上下文来计算对象对的关系重要性分数，并集成到统一的三元组评分机制中。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验表明，RS-Net能持续提升Recall和Precision指标，特别是在mean Recall上有显著提升，有效解决了关系的长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: RS-Net无需改变现有模型架构即可集成到DSGG模型中，在保持竞争力效率的同时实现了优于最先进方法的性能，显著提升了动态场景图生成的质量。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [8] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AAM的轻量级适配模块，可在视频基础模型的潜空间中实现隐私保护，避免敏感信息泄露的同时保持任务实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于像素级别的隐私保护方法需要重新训练整个实用视频模型，且产生特定任务的匿名化效果，不适合视频基础模型。视频基础模型的时空特征泄露敏感个人信息，需要一种能在特征层面有效保护隐私的方法。

Method: 引入轻量级匿名适配模块，在冻结的视频编码器上以即插即用方式应用，设计三个训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标保留已知任务实用性、潜空间一致性损失实现未知任务泛化。

Result: 评估显示隐私泄露减少35%，在动作识别、时序动作检测、异常检测等多个下游任务中保持接近基线的实用性，同时有效减轻动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效可行的视频隐私保护框架，在潜空间实现隐私与实用性的平衡，适用于各类视频基础模型应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现最佳缩放策略高度依赖具体任务，且随着图像分辨率提升，模型规模需要比数据规模更快增长，主要的瓶颈是计算资源而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自回归逐像素预测这一简单但被忽视的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，探索不同计算预算下模型性能的演化规律。

Method: 使用IsoFlops剖面在32x32分辨率图像上训练一系列Transformer模型，计算预算最高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和Fréchet距离衡量的生成质量。

Result: 1) 图像分类和图像生成的最佳缩放策略出现分歧，生成任务需要数据规模增长比分类任务快3-5倍；2) 高分辨率下模型规模需比数据规模增长更快；3) 主要瓶颈是计算资源而非训练数据。

Conclusion: 基于计算资源每年增长4-5倍的预测，逐像素建模图像在五年内具有可行性，计算资源是未来发展的核心限制因素。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

### [10] [Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08711)
*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过微调扩散模型来生成平衡训练数据的方法，用于缓解图像分类中的数据集偏见问题。通过LoRA、DreamBooth等多种微调技术，结合对训练数据的分簇处理，生成更准确的代表性图像。实验表明该方法在多个基准测试上优于原始Stable Diffusion，并在严重偏见场景下超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对图像分类系统中因训练数据中群体代表性不均而产生的偏见问题（如金发与女性的刻板关联），现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始数据分布。本研究旨在探索更准确的扩散模型微调技术来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多种扩散模型微调技术（如LoRA和DreamBooth），特别对每个训练群体内部图像进行聚类，为每个聚类单独训练DreamBooth模型以避免模型被过大的组内变异影响。然后使用这些模型生成群体平衡的预训练数据，最后在真实数据上进行微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，在数据集偏见严重性增加时，其性能可与最先进的去偏见技术（如Group-DRO）相媲美甚至超越。

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型微调和组内聚类技术生成平衡训练数据是一种有效的去偏见方法，特别是在处理严重偏见问题时表现出优越性能，为缓解图像分类中的数据集偏见提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D点云旋转不变学习方法使用手工制作的RI特征替换原始坐标，但会丢失全局姿态信息，导致无法区分几何相似但空间不同的结构（如飞机的左右机翼）。这种限制源于现有RI方法中受限的感受野，导致Wing-tip特征崩溃。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

TL;DR: 该研究使用深度学习方法的EfficientNet架构对胶质母细胞瘤（GBM）的6个组织病理学子区域进行分类，在训练集上达到0.98的F1分数，但在验证集和测试集上分别降至0.546和0.517，表明模型泛化能力存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤预后极差，需要改进诊断方法。自动识别GBM的组织病理学子区域有助于大规模理解该疾病的形态特征。

Method: 设计四步深度学习方法，使用EfficientNet架构（B0-B4变体）在BraTS-Path 2024挑战数据集上进行六类分类，采用5折交叉验证评估。

Result: EfficientNet-B1和B4在训练集上表现最佳（F1=0.98），但在验证集（F1=0.546）和测试集（F1=0.517）上性能明显下降。

Conclusion: 尽管在训练数据上表现优异，但模型在新数据上的泛化能力有限，这突显了开发适用于临床应用的可泛化模型的挑战性。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Conclusion: SemBridge框架有效解决了弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识蒸馏问题，通过创新的匹配和对齐机制显著提升了知识传输效率，展现了在真实世界场景中的实用价值。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉预测与LLM结构先验的半监督文档版面理解框架，通过概率权重融合提升性能，在少量标注数据下取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档版面理解仍然严重依赖大量标注数据，尽管半监督学习已有进展。本文旨在利用LLM的结构先验知识来增强半监督检测性能。

Method: 构建了一个OCR-LLM管道从无标注文档中推断层次化区域，然后通过逆方差融合将教师检测器输出与LLM结构先验结合，生成精炼的伪标签。

Result: 在PubLayNet数据集上，使用仅5%标注数据：SwiftFormer backbone达到88.2±0.3 AP；LayoutLMv3达到89.7±0.4 AP，超越标准半监督学习并匹配需要巨量预训练的UDOP。

Conclusion: LLM结构先验对轻量级和预训练架构都具有互补性，学习到的实例自适应门控比固定权重效果更好，开源LLM可实现隐私保护部署且性能损失小。

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Motivation: 解决文本训练在零样本图像描述中面临的跨域泛化差和幻觉问题，特别是检索方法可能加剧幻觉的挑战

Method: 提出负实体抑制(NES)方法，包含三个集成阶段：使用合成图像确保一致的图像到文本检索；过滤检索内容中的负实体；应用注意力级抑制来减少幻觉倾向特征的影响

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NES保持了有竞争力的域内性能，同时改善了跨域迁移并降低了幻觉率，在零样本图像描述中达到了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过系统化的负实体抑制策略实现了更好的跨域泛化能力

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Conclusion: SPEED-Q首次针对小规模十亿参数VLMs提供完整的低比特量化框架，能够实现准确、稳定且数据高效的复杂VLM量化。

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

Conclusion: BRHVC通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，能够有效协调双向参考帧，实现了优秀的压缩性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Conclusion: AuthSig框架成功解决了静态电子签名的认证问题，通过水印技术实现了可靠的签名验证，为电子签名安全提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Conclusion: CoDR为演示选择提供了既高效又有效的鲁棒解决方案，通过多样化核心子集和双检索机制平衡了性能与效率

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

TL;DR: WDT-MD是一个基于小波扩散Transformer的微动脉瘤检测框架，通过三种创新机制解决现有扩散模型在临床应用中存在的身份映射、假阳性高和正常特征重建不佳的问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微动脉瘤(MA)是糖尿病视网膜病变(DR)的最早期病理特征，人工筛查劳动密集且易出错。现有基于扩散的异常检测方法存在身份映射、难以区分MA与其他异常、正常特征重建不佳三大局限，阻碍临床应用。

Method: 提出WDT-MD框架，包含三个关键创新：1)噪声编码图像条件机制，通过在训练中扰动图像条件避免身份映射；2)伪正常模式合成，通过修复引入像素级监督以区分MA与其他异常；3)小波扩散Transformer架构，结合扩散Transformer的全局建模能力与小波多尺度分析增强正常视网膜特征重建。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的WDT-MD框架显著提升了MA检测性能，对改善早期糖尿病视网膜病变筛查具有重要应用前景。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Result: 在合成和真实图像上的大量实验表明，该模型在强度不均匀和各种噪声类型条件下，相比竞争方法具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 提出的变分分割模型能有效处理强度不均匀图像中的多种噪声污染，结合自适应正则化和偏置场校正，在分割精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni是一个新颖的开放集目标检测框架，通过引入负向视觉提示来解决现有方法仅依赖正向提示导致的视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的开放集目标检测器仅依赖于正向指示器（如文本描述或视觉示例），在面对视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物时存在一致性的脆弱性。

Method: 提出统一的视觉提示编码器联合处理正向和负向视觉提示；训练无关的负向否定计算模块动态抑制概率计算阶段的负向响应；通过负向否定铰链损失增强正负嵌入之间的判别性边界。

Result: 实验证明T-Rex-Omni在零样本检测方面表现卓越，显著缩小了视觉提示和文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景中表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上达到51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负向提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni框架支持正向单独和正负联合两种灵活的推理模式。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为Owl（Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation）的双模态注意力重新加权框架，通过结构因果图建模幻觉过程，以缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语言解码器的缓解方法通常独立调控视觉或文本注意力，忽视了它们作为两个关键因果因素的交互作用。

Method: 我们引入了VTACR（视觉到文本注意力贡献比）来量化解码过程中的模态贡献不平衡，并设计了一个细粒度的注意力干预机制，动态调整基于VTACR信号的标记层和层间注意力。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试上的实验结果表明，Owl实现了显著的幻觉减少，在保持视觉语言理解能力的同时，在忠实度上达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Owl通过建模视觉和文本注意力的交互作用，有效缓解了物体幻觉问题，为大型视觉语言模型的可靠性提升提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 该框架通过耦合答案预测与解释，支持教育和文化保护，强调了可解释性和文化敏感性的重要性。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

Method: 提出方向正交反攻击(DOC)，在反攻击优化中融入正交梯度方向和动量更新，扩展反攻击空间探索；基于平均余弦相似度的方向敏感性评分自适应调整反攻击强度。

Conclusion: 增强反攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对提升测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC通过多样化扰动发现更通用的反攻击，有效中和对抗性扰动。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: CompIL框架为组合零样本学习的持续学习问题提供了有效解决方案，通过视觉合成和语言蒸馏机制实现了对不断涌现组合的增量学习。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average.

Motivation: 当前AI生成视频技术发展迅速，对内容安全和取证分析构成严峻挑战。现有检测器主要依赖像素级视觉线索，对未见过的生成器泛化能力差，需要新的检测方法。

Method: 提出DBINDS检测器：基于扩散模型反演技术，重建视频的初始噪声序列；通过分析真实与生成视频在初始噪声序列上的系统性差异，构建初始噪声差异序列(INDS)；提取多领域、多尺度特征，结合特征优化和贝叶斯搜索调优的LightGBM分类器。

Conclusion: DBINDS通过利用扩散模型内在的生成痕迹，提供了一种新颖有效的AI生成视频检测方案，突破了传统像素级方法的局限性，为内容安全取证提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Conclusion: 该评估框架能够提供临床意义明确、可复现且可扩展的评估，为多模态模型的诊断能力和可信度提供可靠测量

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，包括物体存在性、属性和关系的错误，这降低了模型的可靠性，需要有效的缓解方法。

Method: TACO框架将回答分解为原子查询，通过改写降低对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性或自置信度聚合估计置信度，最终用语言模型精炼答案。

Conclusion: TACO框架通过自验证和置信度校准有效提高了多模态大语言模型的忠实性，展示出良好的幻觉缓解效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Result: 分钟通气量是最具预测力的单一信号，Transformer模型在所有活动中实现最低RMSE（0.87 W/kg）。低强度活动表现最佳（RMSE低至0.29 W/kg），高强度任务误差较大但归一化误差相当。主体间存在强烈变异性。

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RichKD方法，利用CLIP的视觉-语言知识来增强多教师知识蒸馏，通过融合传统教师和CLIP的logit和特征来提高学生模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多教师知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽视了跨模态表示的潜力。本文旨在探索CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为知识蒸馏的补充监督源。

Method: 提出了一个简单而有效的框架，将传统教师的logit和特征与CLIP的logit和特征进行融合，并利用CLIP的多提示文本指导来捕捉数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中 consistently 优于现有基线，表现出更强的鲁棒性，能够提高置信正确的预测案例，减少置信错误的预测，并改善类间一致性和蒸馏质量。

Conclusion: RichKD方法通过融合CLIP的跨模态知识，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果，证明了跨模态监督在知识蒸馏中的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对半监督医学图像分割中教师-学生范式存在的错误确认传播问题，提出了一种内置反馈机制的双教师模型，通过学生反馈和教师间监督来纠正伪标签错误。

Motivation: 传统教师-学生范式在医学图像分割中容易因图像模糊性产生错误监督，且学生对这些错误的反复确认会导致自我强化偏差。现有方法多依赖外部修改，忽视了框架本身的内在纠错潜力。

Method: 在教师-学生框架中引入反馈机制：学生评估教师伪标签引发的变更并提供反馈，教师据此优化伪标签。关键组件包括反馈归因器（识别触发学生更新的伪标签）和反馈接收器（确定反馈应用位置）。进一步提出双教师反馈模型，通过跨教师监督解决分歧并避免一致错误。

Result: 在三个医学图像基准数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法能有效解决半监督医学图像分割中的错误传播问题。

Conclusion: 内置反馈机制的双教师模型能够有效利用教师-学生框架的内在潜力，通过动态反馈循环显著改善半监督医学图像分割的性能，抑制错误传播。

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型的量化难题，为实际部署提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

*Haiyi Li,Qi Chen,Denis Kalkofen,Hsiang-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OUGS的新框架，用于改进3D高斯抛雪球方法在特定对象重建中的效率和质量。该方法通过直接从3D高斯图元的物理参数推导不确定性，并结合语义分割掩码，实现了面向对象的主动视图选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯抛雪球方法虽然在新视角合成方面取得了先进成果，但在复杂场景中高效捕获特定对象的高保真重建仍面临挑战。现有主动重建方法依赖场景级不确定性指标，这些指标容易受到无关背景干扰，导致面向对象任务的视图选择效率低下。

Method: OUGS框架的核心创新是直接从3D高斯图元的显式物理参数（如位置、尺度、旋转）推导不确定性。通过将参数协方差传播到渲染雅可比矩阵，建立可解释的不确定性模型，并整合语义分割掩码生成针对性的对象感知不确定性分数。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验评估表明，该方法显著提高了3DGS重建过程的效率，与现有最先进方法相比，在目标对象上实现了更高质量的重建，同时还能作为全局场景的鲁棒不确定性估计器。

Conclusion: OUGS框架通过物理基础的不确定性建模和对象感知的视图选择策略，有效解决了复杂场景中特定对象重建的效率和精度问题，为3D高斯抛雪球方法的应用提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现了鲁棒的域不变定位，新基准数据集为支气管镜导航的标准化发展提供了基础，展示了在无需域特定适应情况下的稳定2D-3D对齐效果。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Conclusion: 该工作实现了在传统方法难以处理的高密度挑战性场景下对美式足球运动员的鲁棒检测与跟踪，填补了该领域数据集空白。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Conclusion: 双教师知识蒸馏框架有效解决了跨架构蒸馏中的架构不匹配问题，显著提升了轻量级CNN模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何线索且独立预测每个3D姿态，难以解决模糊动作和泛化到真实场景的问题，受人类理解和预期动作方式的启发。

Method: 使用动作提示动态控制去噪过程，引入融合运动学关节亲和力的表示编码器，以及通过幻觉姿态解码器预测时序一致的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP数据集上达到最先进性能，在广播棒球数据集上对模糊噪声输入也表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合高层意图建模和时序一致性处理，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI是一个集成人类监督的机器学框架，用于在保持准确性的同时平衡公平性、隐私保护和人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在实际应用中的普及，需要在准确性之外兼顾公平性、隐私保护和问责制，但现有方法难以同时满足这些要求。

Method: FAIRPLAI通过三个核心机制实现：(1) 构建隐私-公平前沿面，透明展示权衡关系；(2) 支持利益相关者交互式选择公平标准；(3) 嵌入差分隐私审计循环，允许人工审查。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FAIRPLAI在保持强隐私保护的同时，相比自动化基线减少了公平性差异，并提供了直观的解释过程。

Conclusion: FAIRPLAI通过在最关键环节嵌入人类判断，为构建有效、负责任且可信的机器学习系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了LLM-ABS框架，用于研究不同系统提示对LLM智能体行为的影响，发现在独裁者游戏中，AI智能体表现出强烈的公平偏好，且行为对提示变化高度敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究经常忽视系统提示对LLM行为的影响，且结果对提示微小变化非常敏感。在研究LLM复杂行为时需要建立更鲁棒的基线方法。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架，通过(i)探索不同系统提示对模型行为的影响，(ii)使用中性提示变体获得更可靠的智能体偏好洞察，(iii)分析LLM智能体对开放式指令的响应语言特征

Result: 智能体表现出强烈的公平偏好；系统提示对其行为有显著影响；不同模型以不同方式表达响应；提示敏感性仍是持续挑战

Conclusion: LLM-ABS框架为LLM智能体行为研究提供了鲁棒基础，尽管提示敏感性挑战依然存在。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Motivation: 在Gromov-Wasserstein几何框架下研究图粗化问题，旨在通过节点合并来减少图规模同时最小化失真

Method: 提出GPC方法迭代合并最小失真节点对，KGPC方法基于成对失真度量的聚类直接合并节点集群

Result: 方法在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务中表现优异，优于现有方法

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法在各种参数和场景下均优于现有方法，并提供了最优粗化条件保证

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂动力系统的设计和操作中，确保状态轨迹收敛到期望平衡点至关重要，但稳定性区域通常难以预先确定。现有方法依赖于系统显式方程知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出LyapInf方法：假设Lyapunov函数为二次型，通过最小化Zubov方程的平均残差来拟合未知二次算子，从轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数，获得椭圆形的稳定性区域估计。

Result: 数值实验结果表明，该方法成功表征了与推断Lyapunov函数相关的近最大椭圆稳定性区域，无需系统控制方程知识。

Conclusion: LyapInf方法为黑盒动力系统的稳定性分析提供了有效工具，通过数据驱动方式实现了接近最大稳定性区域的估计，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出TIGER（时序图嵌入表示）方法来增强多智能体强化学习，通过建模智能体间协调结构的时序演化，优于现有基于值分解和图的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法依赖静态或单步关系图，忽略了智能体在适应、移动或重组合作策略时自然产生的交互时序演化，而捕捉这种演化依赖关系对于实现稳健自适应协调至关重要。

Method: TIGER构建MARL智能体的动态时序图，连接当前和历史交互，使用时序注意力编码器聚合结构和时序邻域信息，生成时序感知的智能体嵌入来指导合作策略学习。

Result: 在两个协调密集型基准测试中，TIGER在任务性能和样本效率上持续优于多种值分解和图基线的MARL方法。消融研究表明结构和时序因素能共同塑造有效的策略学习。

Conclusion: TIGER通过显式建模智能体协调结构的时序演化，显著提升了MARL的协调能力和学习效率，证明了时序信息在多智能体强化学习中的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DP-PMLF方法，通过结合逐样本动量和低通滤波策略同时缓解差分隐私随机梯度下降中的噪声和偏差问题，提升隐私-效用权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPSGD在提供正式隐私保证的同时，由于引入了噪声和偏置会降低模型准确性。现有技术通常只单独解决其中一个问题，而减少DP噪声可能加剧裁剪偏置，反之亦然

Method: DP-PMLF方法整合了逐样本动量和低通滤波策略：使用逐样本动量在裁剪前平滑梯度估计以减少采样方差；采用后处理低通滤波器在无需消耗额外隐私预算的前提下衰减高频DP噪声

Result: 理论分析表明该方法在严格DP保证下改进了收敛速率，实证评估显示相比于现有DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: DP-PMLF方法能够有效同时缓解差分隐私训练中的噪声和偏置问题，为DPSGD提供了一种更优的隐私保护解决方案

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Conclusion: 通过乘积滤波为强大的图持续描述符开辟了新途径，证实了图乘积拓扑在提升描述符表达能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

TL;DR: 提出了两种图超分辨率框架：Bi-SR通过二分图实现结构感知的节点超分辨率，DEFEND通过双图将边映射为节点来学习边表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图超分辨率方法存在两个关键限制：基于矩阵的节点超分辨率忽略了图结构且缺乏置换不变性；依赖节点表示推断边权重限制了可扩展性和表达力。

Method: 1. Bi-SR框架构建LR和HR节点间的二分图，实现保持拓扑和置换不变性的结构感知节点超分辨率；2. DEFEND框架通过学习边表示，将HR边映射到双图的节点上，使用基于节点的GNN进行边推断。

Result: 在真实世界大脑连接组数据集上，两个框架在七个拓扑度量上均达到state-of-the-art性能；创建了12个模拟数据集用于全面基准测试。

Conclusion: 提出的GNN不可知框架有效解决了现有图超分辨率方法的局限性，为资源受限领域（如医学）提供了高效的数据获取解决方案。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Motivation: 先前的研究在玩具模型上证明了参数分解的有效性，但尚未应用于真实模型。本研究旨在弥补这一差距，将SPD方法扩展到现代Transformer模型。

Method: 扩展随机参数分解（SPD）到Transformer模型，提出了更新的因果重要性函数（适用于序列数据）和新的损失函数。在玩具感应头模型和GPT-2-small模型上进行验证。

Result: 成功分解了玩具感应头模型并恢复了预期的2步电路；在GPT-2-small中成功定位了对应"高尔夫"、"篮球"等可解释概念的子组件。

Conclusion: 这是将SPD扩展到现代模型的第一步，证明该方法可以用于发现可解释的参数空间机制，为机械可解释性研究提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的SWE预测方法未能充分利用时空相关性，且无法提供不确定性估计，而这对水资源管理决策具有重要意义

Method: ForeSWE模型整合注意力机制来捕捉时空特征和交互作用，同时使用高斯过程模块进行预测不确定性的量化

Result: 在西美国512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，相比现有方法在预测精度和预测区间方面均取得显著改进

Conclusion: 该模型为水资源管理社区提供了部署和反馈的平台，突出了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑电分析基础模型面临两个关键挑战：(1)不同设备和配置导致的跨数据集变异性，(2)脑电信号信噪比低，神经信号常被伪迹和非脑源噪声掩盖

Method: 1)引入基于位置的信道嵌入处理可变信道配置；2)在原始和潜在空间采用噪声感知掩码重建策略；3)在重建前通过字典启发式卷积变换(DiCT)层将信号投影到结构化特征空间

Result: 在不同设备采集的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游脑电任务中优于现有最优方法，并在电极布局不同的跨域场景中表现优异

Conclusion: EEG-X通过创新的位置嵌入和双空间降噪重建策略，成功解决了脑电分析中的跨设备泛化和噪声鲁棒性问题，为脑电基础模型的发展提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts. The models and code are available at: https://github.com/Emotiv/EEG-X

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合Transformer和1D CNN的两阶段架构，通过融入临床元数据和专家事件标注等上下文信息，显著提升了自动睡眠分期的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动睡眠分期耗时且存在评分者间差异，现有深度学习模型大多仅依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：Transformer编码器处理每个时段信号，1D CNN聚合器整合信息；系统研究融合临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧下降、觉醒等）的效果。

Result: 在SHHS数据集（n=8,357）上，相比仅使用PSG信号的基线模型（macro-F1 0.7745），融合上下文信息的最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031，其中事件标注贡献最大增益。

Conclusion: 融合临床有意义特征能同时提升性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG配置或额外传感器，为构建上下文感知的专家对齐睡眠分期系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

Result: 研究发现，当Ω值较高时，大型时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线模型；而当Ω值降低时，TSFMs的优势消失。计算Ω仅需每数据集几秒钟，能够快速评估数据是否适合TSFM方法。

Conclusion: 谱可预测性Ω能够可预测地对模型性能进行分层，作为一种实用的初步筛选工具，可以显著降低验证成本，同时突显了开发在真正困难（低Ω）问题上表现优异的模型的必要性，而不仅仅是优化简单问题。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，由于分布外动作导致的价值高估限制策略性能，现有方法对低质量数据的冗余动作进行无差别正则化，导致过度保守和扩散模型效率与表达能力的不平衡。

Method: 提出DIVO方法，引入基于动作优势值的二元加权机制来指导扩散模型训练，动态筛选高回报潜力动作，实现在线策略改进。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，DIVO在运动任务上实现显著的平均回报提升，在具挑战性的AntMaze领域优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIVO在离线强化学习中成功平衡了保守性与探索性，为处理稀疏奖励环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

TL;DR: Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE) 是一种后处理不确定性估计框架，专门为微调后的大型语言模型设计。该方法对MoE架构中每个专家的第二线性层应用结构化的拉普拉斯近似，无需修改原训练过程即可实现校准后的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将贝叶斯推理应用于额外添加的适配器模块，而本方法直接利用MoE模型中已有的专家路径，发挥其模块化设计的优势，以实现更高效的分块后验估计。

Method: 采用基于Kronecker分解的低秩近似来建模曲率，并推导出可扩展的预测不确定性和边缘似然估计。对每个专家的第二线性层应用结构化拉普拉斯近似，不引入新参数。

Result: 在常识推理基准测试中，使用Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE进行的实验表明，Bayesian-MoE在期望校准误差(ECE)和负对数似然(NLL)上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE框架为下游可靠决策提供了有效的工具，证实了其在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计通过将试验转变为适应性模块化研究，使每次模型迭代都能获得I级证据，加速AI在临床中的成本效益转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了非欧几里得流形数据聚类的计算效率，在保持精度的同时大幅减少计算时间。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）对可靠性的严重影响，现有不变学习方法难以准确捕获不变特征并直接构建因果表示。

Method: FedSDWC方法通过建模不变特征与变异特征之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示，突破了现有方法的局限。

Conclusion: FedSDWC能有效处理协变量和语义偏移，显著提升联邦学习的泛化能力和OOD数据检测性能。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven stress detection is critical for equitable mental healthcare, yet existing models frequently exhibit gender bias, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. To address this, we propose FairM2S, a fairness-aware meta-learning framework for stress detection leveraging audio-visual data. FairM2S integrates Equalized Odds constraints during both meta-training and adaptation phases, employing adversarial gradient masking and fairness-constrained meta-updates to effectively mitigate bias. Evaluated against five state-of-the-art baselines, FairM2S achieves 78.1% accuracy while reducing the Equal Opportunity to 0.06, demonstrating substantial fairness gains. We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Conclusion: 通过可学习的类别关系，该方法显著增强了聚类算法的拟合能力，特别是在处理分类属性和混合数据集时表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Conclusion: FedPM有效解决了二阶优化在联邦学习中的预处理器漂移问题，充分发挥了二阶优化的潜力，在异构数据环境下表现出优越性能

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RLHF/DPO流程的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具，为防御机制设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Interlat（智能体间潜在空间通信）方法，通过直接传输LLM隐藏状态来实现更深入的信息交换，避免了自然语言下采样的信息损失。


<details>

Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体通信媒介存在根本限制，将丰富的内部潜在状态降采样为离散标记的过程会限制信息传输的深度和细微差别，从而阻碍协作问题解决。

Method: 提出Interlat范式，利用LLM的最后一个隐藏状态作为其思维的表示进行直接传输（称为潜在通信），并通过完全潜在空间推理进行额外压缩。

Conclusion: 该工作是对完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果凸显了其潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Motivation: 跨域迁移中现有方法选择的源轨迹片段拼接性差，存在状态结构错位、RTG不可比、动作跳跃等问题，影响DT推理能力。

Method: 使用最大均值差异(MMD)和最优传输(OT)进行双层数据过滤，融合目标数据与可信源片段；用优势条件令牌替代RTG令牌；应用Q引导正则化抑制连接点跳跃。

Result: 在D4RL式控制任务的重力、运动学和形态迁移上，DFDT相比强基线在回报和稳定性方面均有提升，并通过拼接性和语义稳定性分析验证。

Conclusion: DFDT通过数据融合和语义连续性改进有效解决了跨域决策Transformer的拼接性问题，理论分析表明性能差距与MMD和OT度量相关。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

TL;DR: FSampler通过预测epsilon信号来减少扩散模型采样时的函数评估次数，在保持高质量（SSIM 0.95-0.99）的同时减少15-25%的模型调用，加速8-22%的采样时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少扩散模型采样过程中的计算开销，通过减少函数评估次数来加速采样过程，同时保持生成质量。

Method: 使用有限差分预测器（二阶、三阶或四阶）基于历史去噪信号预测epsilon，在特定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，包含学习稳定器、梯度估计稳定器等机制确保稳定性。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev等模型上，FSampler在高质量设置下减少15-25%模型调用，加速8-22%；在激进模式下可减少45-50%模型调用但质量有所下降。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种训练免费、采样器无关的加速方案，能够显著减少扩散模型采样时的计算成本，同时保持较高的生成质量。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的MILP求解方法存在两个层面的结构错位：学习目标层面，二元交叉熵损失忽视了变量间的优先级关系；模型架构层面，标准GNN消息传递平滑了变量表示，忽略了约束中的竞争关系。

Method: 提出CoCo-MILP方法，包含两个核心创新：1）变量间对比损失（VCL），最大化赋值1和0的变量嵌入间隔；2）约束内竞争GNN层，学习约束内竞争变量的差异化表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoCo-MILP显著优于现有学习方法，相比传统求解器将求解差距降低了最高68.12%。

Conclusion: CoCo-MILP通过显式建模变量间的对比关系和约束内的竞争机制，有效解决了GNN在MILP问题中的结构错配问题，为学习加速组合优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Conclusion: SCMax通过自监督共识最大化为确定最优聚类数量提供了有效标准，实现了完全参数自由的聚类，解决了传统方法对超参数依赖的局限性。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Motivation: 虽然基于扩散的模型能够生成真实多样的蛋白质结构，但在引导结果朝向特定功能或生化目标（如结合亲和力或序列组成）方面仍然存在局限。需要一种能够同时控制结构和序列属性的方法。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了推理时间的FK控制可以将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意目标，为引导分子生成提供了一个统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Conclusion: 通过将MBRL应用于分支定界中的变量选择问题，能够有效提升MILP问题的求解效率，证明了学习动态模型方法的有效性。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

Result: 实验验证MoC显著降低内存占用并提高吞吐量，同时保持竞争性的模型性能。

Conclusion: MoC有效解决了FFN激活内存瓶颈问题，为大规模语言模型的高效训练和推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出CREAT方法来解决Profile Pollution Attack(PPA)中的两个局限性，通过约束强化学习平衡攻击效果与隐蔽性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPA方法存在两个局限：过度依赖序列水平影响限制了细粒度扰动，整体修改导致可检测的分布偏移

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层优化框架和多奖励强化学习，包含模式平衡奖励策略和约束组相对强化学习

Result: 广泛的实验证明了CREAT的有效性，能够实现精准污染且检测性最小

Conclusion: CREAT方法成功解决了PPA的挑战，在保持攻击效果的同时提高了隐蔽性

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GDPR等隐私法规的推行，现有时空图模型面临完整删除授权数据的挑战。由于节点信息会在时空维度全局扩散，传统局部删除方法效率低下，需要近乎完全重训练的高成本。

Method: 提出CallosumNet框架，采用类似胼胝体的分治策略：1）增强子图构建技术，基于生物启发式虚拟神经节自适应构建局部子图；2）全局神经节桥接技术，从局部子图重建全局时空依赖关系。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，CallosumNet仅产生1%-2%的相对MAE损失即可实现完整遗忘，显著优于现有基准方法。消融实验验证了所提技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CallosumNet成功解决了时空图数据遗忘的挑战，为隐私合规的图学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

TL;DR: WOODELF是一种新的SHAP算法，通过将决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑统一到框架中，实现Background SHAP的线性时间计算，在CPU和GPU上均能高效运行，相比现有方法获得16-165倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP是解释决策树集成模型的重要工具，但现有计算方法效率有限。研究旨在开发一个统一框架，能够高效计算多种博弈论值（包括Background SHAP、Path-Dependent SHAP等），并在不同硬件平台上实现高性能。

Method: WOODELF为每个样本构建伪布尔公式，整合特征值、决策树集成结构和完整背景数据集。该表示框架支持线性时间计算Background SHAP，同时兼容其他博弈论值的计算。算法基于NumPy、SciPy和CuPy实现，无需自定义C++或CUDA代码。

Result: 在300万行数据、500万背景样本、127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上计算所有Background Shapley值需162秒，GPU上仅需16秒，相比现有最佳方法的44分钟，分别实现16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效统一的SHAP计算框架，显著提升了计算性能，支持大规模实际应用，且具有良好的硬件兼容性和易集成性。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Motivation: 随着PET成像对无约束探测器布局（如walk-through设计和长轴环）的需求增加，这些布局中的间隙和开放侧会导致严重的欠采样投影数据。传统方法要求硬件形成完整的圆柱体，而本研究旨在通过数据驱动方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出将缺失的响应线视为可学习的先验，并探索使用条件扩散模型来插值稀疏采样的投影数据。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型在恢复PET成像中缺失信息方面显示出潜力，有望推动非传统探测器布局的应用。

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Conclusion: AGT为训练数据扰动的认证提供了一种形式化分析方法，扩展了机器学习模型鲁棒性认证的研究范畴。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在混合难度样本上训练时存在梯度饥饿和策略退化问题。虽然先前的链式思维（CoT）数据和课程学习策略有所探索，但存在标注成本高、难度不匹配、手动课程设计依赖以及灾难性遗忘等挑战。

Method: 提出AdaCuRL框架，整合了粗到细的难度估计和自适应课程调度，动态对齐数据难度与模型能力，并采用数据重访机制减轻灾难性遗忘。同时使用自适应参考和稀疏KL策略来防止策略退化。

Result: 在多个推理基准上的广泛实验表明，AdaCuRL在大语言模型（LLMs）和多模态大模型（MLLMs）上均取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为提升语言模型的推理能力提供了一种高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为PTE的无保留遗忘框架，通过探索后编辑的方法在动态IIoT环境中实现高效选择性遗忘，仅使用待遗忘数据和原始模型即达到遗忘与模型效用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态工业物联网环境中，模型需要能够选择性地遗忘过时或错误知识。现有方法通常依赖保留数据来约束模型行为，但这会增加计算和能量负担，并与工业数据孤岛和隐私合规要求相冲突。

Method: PTE框架将遗忘视为探索-编辑过程：首先通过梯度上升探测待遗忘类的决策边界邻域，生成编辑指令；随后进行推-拉协作优化：推分支使用编辑指令主动拆除目标类的决策区域，拉分支应用带掩码的知识蒸馏将保留类的知识锚定到原始状态。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTE在多个通用和工业基准（如CWRU和SCUT-FD）上，在遗忘有效性和模型效用之间实现了出色的平衡。

Conclusion: PTE框架受益于其机制，仅使用待遗忘数据和原始模型就能实现高效平衡的知识编辑，为动态工业物联网环境中的选择性遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Method: 使用预训练的Transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制语义距离SD_t来生成与父代语义相似但结构不同的子代程序

Result: 在24个真实和合成数据集上，TSGP平均排名1.58，显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，同时产生比SLIM_GSGP更紧凑的解

Conclusion: SD_t参数能有效控制语义空间中的步长，平衡探索与利用：小值实现持续改进但程序较大，大值促进快速收敛和紧凑性

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动力学模型或策略学习提供了一种轻量级替代方案，展示了在嵌入空间中进行直接规划的潜力。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSynth是一个自动合成数据框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和混合奖励机制解决监督微调中的冷启动问题，无需参考数据集即可优化工作流，在主观任务中显著减少人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调方法需要高质量标注数据，但人工标注成本高昂。现有的自动数据合成方法存在冷启动问题，需要预先的标注数据集来建模奖励函数，这在主观、开放式任务中尤其困难，因为没有客观的基准真值。

Method: AutoSynth将工作流发现和优化问题重构为蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用一种无需数据集的混合奖励机制进行引导。该奖励通过两个基于LLM的评价组件实现元学习：一个使用动态生成的任务特定指标评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码和提示的质量。

Result: 在主观教育任务上的实验表明，AutoSynth生成数据训练的模型显著优于基线方法（40-51% vs. 2-5%），在某些指标上达到或超过了专家设计的工作流。同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到仅30分钟（减少超过90%）。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了一种可扩展、高成本效益的方法，能够发现超出人类直觉的质量维度。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种二阶确定性演员-评论家强化学习框架，通过利用性能函数的曲率信息来改进经典确定性策略梯度方法。该方法引入了二次评论家，同时保留真实策略梯度和性能Hessian矩阵近似，并使用最小二乘时序差分学习方案高效估计参数，从而实现拟牛顿策略更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的确定性演员-评论家方法只利用一阶梯度信息，收敛速度较慢。为了利用性能函数的二阶曲率信息，作者希望扩展经典方法以包含Hessian矩阵信息，从而加快收敛速度。

Method: 提出兼容函数逼近的二次评论家，既能保留真实策略梯度又能逼近性能Hessian矩阵。设计最小二乘时序差分学习方案估计二次评论家参数，并基于此实现拟牛顿策略更新算法。

Conclusion: 该二阶确定性演员-评论家框架成功地将曲率信息整合到强化学习策略优化中，为任何可微策略类提供了通用的二阶优化方法，显著提升了收敛效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

TL;DR: GenePheno是一个可解释的多标签预测框架，直接从基因序列预测基因敲除诱导的表型异常，通过对比学习和生物学一致性约束实现多表型相关性的建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖特定基因变体对有限表型的影响，或需要经过整理的遗传信息作为输入，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。直接从基因序列广泛预测基因敲除诱导的多种表型异常的研究仍然不足。

Method: 开发了GenePheno框架，采用对比多标签学习目标捕捉表型间相关性，结合专门正则化确保生物学一致性，并引入基因功能瓶颈层提供可解释的功能机制。

Conclusion: GenePheno首次实现了从基因序列直接预测基因敲除诱导的多表型异常，填补了该领域的研究空白，为可扩展的假说驱动实验提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究分析了捏合天线系统(PASSs)的能量效率，通过开发功率分布的连贯公式，重点研究通过调整捏合耦合和位置来间接控制天线功率分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探究捏合天线系统的能量效率问题，因为这类系统中每个天线的功率分布并非通过明确的功率分配策略控制，而是通过调整捏合耦合和位置来实现间接控制。

Method: 开发了一类混合动态-静态算法，通过以不同速率更新系统参数来最大化能量效率。具体包括：(1) 使用可移动元件动态调整捏合位置；(2) 通过改变捏合元件的有效耦合长度来调整耦合。

Result: 实验结果表明，动态调整捏合位置能够显著提升捏合天线系统的能量效率。特别是在用户移动性较低的场景下，动态调整位置是可行的。

Conclusion: 通过混合动态-静态算法来优化捏合天线系统的参数设置，可以有效提升系统的能量效率，其中动态调整捏合位置是实现能量效率显著提升的关键因素。

Abstract: We study the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) by developing a consistent formulation for power distribution in these systems. The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs.

Conclusion: OG-PCL提供了一個緊湊而準確的框架，可在輕量級平台上實現實時雷達基於人類活動識別。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) with millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar offers a privacy-preserving and robust alternative to camera- and wearable-based approaches. In this work, we propose the Occupancy-Gated Parallel-CNN Bi-LSTM (OG-PCL) network to process sparse 3D radar point clouds produced by mmWave sensing. Designed for lightweight deployment, the parameter size of the proposed OG-PCL is only 0.83M and achieves 91.75 accuracy on the RadHAR dataset, outperforming those existing baselines such as 2D CNN, PointNet, and 3D CNN methods. We validate the advantages of the tri-view parallel structure in preserving spatial information across three dimensions while maintaining efficiency through ablation studies. We further introduce the Occupancy-Gated Convolution (OGConv) block and demonstrate the necessity of its occupancy compensation mechanism for handling sparse point clouds. The proposed OG-PCL thus offers a compact yet accurate framework for real-time radar-based HAR on lightweight platforms.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种线性偏置IF-TEM（LB-IF-TEM）方法，通过动态调整偏置来跟踪输入信号，实现更集中的触发间隔分布，从而在保持重建精度的同时显著降低比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IF-TEM方法在编码信息分布平滑的信号时存在过度采样问题，导致编码效率低下。本文旨在解决这一问题，提高时间编码的效率。

Method: 引入线性偏置IF-TEM（LB-IF-TEM），使偏置动态跟踪输入信号，保持积分器输入近乎恒定，从而实现触发间隔的局部化分布。

Result: 理论分析明确了可实现的过采样范围界限，实验结果表明该方法在显著降低比特率的同时达到了与现有IF-TEM变体相当的重建精度。

Conclusion: LB-IF-TEM提供了一个低功耗、通信效率高且分析可控的时间基信号编码与重建框架。

Abstract: Integrate-and-fire time encoding machines (IF-TEMs) provide an efficient framework for asynchronous sampling of bandlimited signals through discrete firing times. However, conventional IF-TEMs often exhibit excessive oversampling, leading to inefficient encoding for signals with smoothly distributed information. This letter introduces a linear-bias IF-TEM (LB-IF-TEM), where the bias dynamically tracks the input signal to maintain a nearly constant integrator input, thereby localizing the firing intervals. The resulting concentrated distribution enables effective non-uniform quantization with reduced distortion. Theoretical analysis establishes explicit bounds on the achievable oversampling range, while experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method attains comparable reconstruction accuracy at significantly lower bitrate than existing IF-TEM variants. The LB-IF-TEM thus provides a low-power, communication-efficient, and analytically tractable framework for time-based signal encoding and reconstruction.

Motivation: 由于传统的时频调制方案在大延迟和多普勒扩展的双选择性信道中性能不佳，需要设计新的调制方案。

Method: 开发了一个分析框架，使用非选择性和可预测性这两个特性来评估调制方案的多样性和频谱效率。

Result: 发现延迟-多普勒、啁啾和时序域调制是非选择性、可预测且相互等效的，而时频调制是选择性和非可预测的。

Conclusion: 延迟-多普勒、啁啾和时序域调制在双选择性信道中具有更好的性能，它们通过非选择性和可预测性特性实现了更高的多样性和频谱效率。

Abstract: There is significant recent interest in designing new modulation schemes for doubly-selective channels with large delay and Doppler spreads, where legacy modulation schemes based on time-frequency signal representations do not perform well. In this paper, we develop a framework for analyzing such modulations using two characteristics -- non-selectivity and predictability -- which directly relate to the diversity and spectral efficiency that the modulations achieve. We show that modulations in the delay-Doppler, chirp and time-sequency domains are non-selective, predictable and equivalent to one another, whereas time-frequency modulations are selective and non-predictable.

Conclusion: 结构化潜在空间方法能有效克服线性组合假设的局限性，生成更真实的EMG合成模式，显著提升对未见组合运动的分类性能，为 prosthesis 控制等应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG)-based motion classification using machine learning has been widely employed in applications such as prosthesis control. While previous studies have explored generating synthetic patterns of combined motions to reduce training data requirements, these methods assume that combined motions can be represented as linear combinations of basic motions. However, this assumption often fails due to complex neuromuscular phenomena such as muscle co-contraction, resulting in low-fidelity synthetic signals and degraded classification performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that learns to synthesize combined motion patterns in a structured latent space. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode EMG signals into a low-dimensional representation and introduce a mixconsistency loss that structures the latent space such that combined motions are embedded between their constituent basic motions. Synthetic patterns are then generated within this structured latent space and used to train classifiers for recognizing unseen combined motions. We validated our approach through upper-limb motion classification experiments with eight healthy participants. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms input-space synthesis approaches, achieving approximately 30% improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: 论文提出了基于格基导频模式的最优设计方法，在双弥散信道中实现了接近理论下界的LMMSE信道估计性能，为OFDM系统提供了有效的导频设计方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal pilot pattern design, in the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator sense, for OFDM systems in doubly dispersive channels. To enable analytical tractability, the channel covariance matrix is decomposed into the Kronecker product of two Hermitian Toeplitz matrices corresponding to the delay and Doppler domains. By invoking the Szegö limit theorem, these matrices are shown to be approximately diagonalizable by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices. Based on this structure, the LMMSE channel estimation error is reformulated into a compact analytical form, from which a closed-form lower bound is derived. Furthermore, we establish the condition under which this bound is achieved by a lattice-based pilot pattern. Numerical results verify that the proposed matrix approximation introduces negligible error and examples of the proposed lattice design are given.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic analysis of inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference (ISCI) modeling in doubly dispersive channels for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We propose a generalized OFDM (Weyl-Heisenberg) framework to evaluate four ISCI treatment approaches: (1) explicit estimation and compensation, (2) complete ignorance, (3) uncorrelated colored noise approximation, and (4) correlated colored noise modeling. Through continuous delay-Doppler channel characterization, we derive LMMSE channel estimators and corresponding estimation errors (as sensing metrics) for both pilot-assisted and fully-known symbol scenarios. The communication performance is quantified via ergodic capacity bounds under imperfect CSI. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal fundamental performance-complexity trade-offs, providing insights for practical ISAC waveform and receiver design in doubly dispersive channels.

Abstract: In-air acoustic imaging systems demand beamforming techniques that offer a high dynamic range and spatial resolution while also remaining robust. Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging.

Abstract: Recently, the pinching-antenna system (PASS) has emerged as a promising architecture owing to its ability to reconfigure large-scale path loss and signal phase by activating radiation points along a dielectric waveguide. However, existing studies mainly focus on line-shaped PASS architectures, whose limited spatial flexibility constrains their applicability in multiuser and indoor scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional (2D) pinching-antenna system (2D-PASS) that extends the conventional line-shaped structure into a continuous dielectric waveguide plane, thereby forming a reconfigurable radiating plane capable of dynamic beam adaptation across a 2D spatial domain. An optimization framework is developed to maximize the minimum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among user equipments (UEs) by adaptively adjusting the spatial configuration of pinching antennas (PAs), serving as an analog beamforming mechanism for dynamic spatial control. For the continuous-position scenario, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently explore the nonconvex search space, while a discrete variant is introduced to accommodate practical hardware constraints with limited PA placement resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 2D-PASS substantially improves the minimum SNR compared with conventional line-shaped PASS and fixed-position antenna (FPA) benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under varying user distributions and distances.

Conclusion: 提出的数字孪生辅助通道制图方法能够有效生成真实空间坐标系中的位置估计，显著提升了定位精度和实用性

Abstract: Channel charting (CC) is a self-supervised positioning technique whose main limitation is that the estimated positions lie in an arbitrary coordinate system that is not aligned with true spatial coordinates. In this work, we propose a novel method to produce CC locations in true spatial coordinates with the aid of a digital twin (DT). Our main contribution is a new framework that (i) extracts large-scale channel-state information (CSI) features from estimated CSI and the DT and (ii) matches these features with a cosine-similarity loss function. The DT-aided loss function is then combined with a conventional CC loss to learn a positioning function that provides true spatial coordinates without relying on labeled data. Our results for a simulated indoor scenario demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the relative mean distance error by 29% compared to the state of the art. We also show that the proposed approach is robust to DT modeling mismatches and a distribution shift in the testing data.

Abstract: This paper presents a maximum-likelihood detection framework that jointly mitigates hardware (HW) impairments in both amplitude and phase. By modeling transceiver distortions as residual amplitude and phase noise, we introduce the approximate phase-and-amplitude distortion detector (PAD-D), which operates in the polar domain and effectively mitigates both distortion components through distortion-aware weighting. The proposed detector performs reliable detection under generalized HW impairment conditions, achieving substantial performance gains over the conventional Euclidean detector (EUC-D) and the Gaussian-assumption phase noise detector (GAP-D), which is primarily designed to address phase distortions. In addition, we derive a closed-form high-SNR symbol error probability (SEP) approximation, which offers a generic analytical expression applicable to arbitrary constellations. Simulation results demonstrate that the PAD-D achieves up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the error floor relative to EUC-D and GAP-D for both high-order quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and super amplitude phase-shift keying (SAPSK) constellations, establishing a unified and practical framework for detection under realistic transceiver impairments. Building on this framework, we further develop optimized constellations tailored to PAD-D, where the symbol positions are optimized in the complex plane to minimize SEP. The optimality of these constellations is confirmed through extensive simulations, which also verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical SEP approximation, even for the optimized designs.

Abstract: This paper presents a physics-consistent framework for bistatic sensing incorporating a 2-Dimensional (2D) waveguide-fed metasurface antenna array capable of realizing eXtremely-Large Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (XL MIMO) apertures. A coupled-dipole model is presented that captures the array's mutual coupling due to both waveguide and free-space interactions, and a novel passivity constraint on the corresponding magnetic polarizabilities is proposed. Focusing on a bistatic sensing setup, we leverage a Neumann-series approximation of the array response model and derive the Cramer-Rao bound for multi-target parameter estimation, which is then incorporated into a sensing optimization formulation with respect to the metasurface's per-element resonance strength configuration. Simulation results on the position error bound in the radiative near field with the proposed design quantify the critical role of metamaterial placement in strongly coupled metasurface-based XL MIMO bistatic sensing systems.

Abstract: The sensitivity of the acoustic detection subsystem in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) critically affects image quality. However, previous studies often focused only on front-end acoustic components or back-end electronic components, overlooking end-to-end coupling among the transducer, cable, and receiver. This work develops a complete analytical model for system-level sensitivity optimization based on the Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthaei (KLM) model. The KLM model is rederived from first principles of linear piezoelectric constitutive equations, 1D wave equations and transmission line theory to clarify its physical basis and applicable conditions. By encapsulating the acoustic components into a controlled voltage source and extending the model to include lumped-parameter representations of cable and receiver, an end-to-end equivalent circuit is established. Analytical expressions for the system transfer functions are derived, revealing the coupling effects among key parameters such as transducer element area (EA), cable length (CL), and receiver impedance (RI). Experimental results validate the model with an average error below 5%. Additionally, a low-frequency tailing phenomenon arising from exceeding the 1D vibration assumption is identified and analyzed, illustrating the importance of understanding the model's applicable conditions and providing a potential pathway for artifact suppression. This work offers a comprehensive framework for optimizing detection sensitivity and improving image fidelity in PAI systems.

Abstract: Fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensing technology with broad industrial applications. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal morphology of DAS signals presents analytical challenges where conventional methods prove suboptimal, while being well-suited for deep learning approaches. Although our previous work, DAS Masked Autoencoder (DAS-MAE), established state-of-the-art performance and generalization without labels, it is not satisfactory in frequency analysis in temporal-dominated DAS data. Moreover, the limitation of effective training data fails to address the substantial data requirements inherent to Transformer architectures in DAS-MAE. To overcome these limitations, we present an enhanced framework incorporating short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for explicit temporal-frequency feature extraction and pioneering video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training to mitigate data constraints. This approach learns high-level representations (e.g., event classification) through label-free reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate transformative improvements: 0.1% error rate in few-shot classification (90.9% relative improvement over DAS-MAE) and 4.7% recognition error in external damage prevention applications (75.4% improvement over from-scratch training). As the first work to pioneer video-to-DAS cross-modal pre-training, available training resources are expanded by bridging computer vision and distributed sensing areas. The enhanced performance and generalization facilitate DAS deployment across diverse industrial scenarios while advancing cross-modal representation learning for industrial IoT sensing.

Abstract: This paper adapts a Multiple-Model Coding (MMC) approach for sampled electrical signal waveforms to satisfy reconstructed signal quality constraints. The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.

Motivation: 为了提高多用户MIMO通信中波束训练的智能化水平，减少训练开销，需要开发更智能的波束训练机制。为此，提出利用大语言模型来实现上下文感知和环境自适应的波束训练。

Abstract: To enable intelligent beam training, a large language model (LLM)-enabled beam training framework is proposed for the pinching antenna system (PASS) in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. A novel LLM-based beam training supervised learning mechanism is developed, allowing context-aware and environment-adaptive probing for PASS to reduce overheads. Both single-user and multi-user cases are considered. 1) For single-user case, the LLM-based pinching beamforming codebook generation problem is formulated to maximize the beamforming gain. Then, the optimal transmit beamforming is obtained by maximum ratio transmission (MRT). 2) For multi-user case, a joint codebook generation and beam selection problem is formulated based on the system sum rate under the minimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit beamforming. The training labels for pinching beamforming are constructed by selecting the beam combination that maximizes system performance from each user's Top-S candidate beams. Based on pretrained Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), the LLM is trained in an end-to-end fashion to minimize the cross-entropy loss. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) For single-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS attains over 95% Top-1 accuracy in beam selection and achieves 51.92% improvements in beamforming gains compared to conventional method. ii) For multi-user case, the proposed LLM-enabled PASS framework significantly outperforms both the LLM-based massive MIMO and conventional PASS beam training, achieving up to 57.14% and 33.33% improvements in sum rate, respectively.

Abstract: This paper investigates a fluid antenna system (FAS) where a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a fluid antenna (FA) over a Rician fading channel. Considering that multiple ports among the M available FA ports can be activated, the receiver selects the best K with the highest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and combines the received signals at the selected ports using maximum ratio combining. The statistics of the post-combining SNR are derived using a Laplace transform-based approach, which allows to analyze the outage probability (OP) of the FAS. Additional closed-form expressions for a lower bound on the OP and the asymptotic OP at high SNR are presented. Numerical results validate the analytical framework and demonstrate the interplay of key system parameters on the performance of the considered MRC-based FAS.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用代数几何码的迹构建二进制码的方法，通过分析迹代数几何码来逼近Gilbert-Varshamov界，建立了适用于此类分析的Hasse-Weil型定理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决编码理论中最古老的问题之一：用显式二进制码匹配Gilbert-Varshamov界。通过利用代数几何码在大常数字段上超越GV界的现象，希望即使在从常数字段扩展到二进制字段时，代数几何码超越GV界的优势仍能保持。

Method: 采用迹代数几何码方法，通过在常数字段扩展中取代数几何码的迹来构建二进制码。与传统的级联方法不同，此方法在整个过程中（包括字母表缩减步骤）都利用代数几何码的代数结构。

Result: 建立了一个适用于迹代数几何码分析的Hasse-Weil型定理，证明了现有经典定理在此设置下不足。虽然未获得改进的构造，但显示常因子加强边界就足够。在高距离区域，迹代数几何码劣于码级联。

Conclusion: 提出的Hasse-Weil型定理在分析迹代数几何码方面具有广泛适用性，并为指数和提供了新的估计。该方法为逼近Gilbert-Varshamov界提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: One of the oldest problems in coding theory is to match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with explicit binary codes. Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.
  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums.

Conclusion: 紧凑的自编码器架构可以通过简单稳定的训练有效学习结构化的代数最优二进制码，为数据驱动的通信系统设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Error correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.

Abstract: A $(k+r,k,l)$ binary array code of length $k+r$, dimension $k$, and sub-packetization $l$ is composed of $l\times(k+r)$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$, with every column of the matrix stored on a separate node in the distributed storage system and viewed as a coordinate of the codeword. It is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if any $k$ out of $k+r$ coordinates suffice to reconstruct the whole codeword. The repair problem of binary MDS array codes has drawn much attention, particularly for single-node failures. In this paper, given an arbitrary binary MDS array code with sub-packetization $m$ as the base code, we propose two generic approaches (Generic Construction I and II) for constructing binary MDS array codes with optimal access (or repair) bandwidth for single-node failures. For every $s\leq r$, a $(k+r,k,ms^{\lceil \frac{k+r}{s}\rceil})$ code $\mathcal{C}_1$ with optimal access bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction I. Repairing a failed node of $\mathcal{C}_1$ requires connecting to $d = k+s-1$ helper nodes, in which $s-1$ helper nodes are designated and $k$ are free to select. $\mathcal{C}_1$ generally achieves smaller sub-packetization and provides greater flexibility in the selection of its coefficient matrices. For even $r\geq4$ and $s=\frac{r}{2}$ such that $s+1$ divides $k+r$, a $(k+r, k,ms^{\frac{k+r}{s+1}})$ code $\mathcal{C}_2$ with optimal repair bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction II, with $\frac{s}{s+1}(k+r)$ out of $k+r$ nodes having the optimal access property. To the best of our knowledge, $\mathcal{C}_2$ possesses the smallest sub-packetization among existing binary MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth known to date.

Conclusion: 通过频域中的可移动信号概念可以实现智能无线电环境，这种方法可以克服现有技术的实现挑战。

Abstract: Smart radio environments (SREs) enhance wireless communications by allowing control over the channel. They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals.

Abstract: Rate distortion theory treats the problem of encoding a source with minimum codebook size while at the same time allowing for a certain amount of errors in the reconstruction measured by a fidelity criterion and distortion level. Similar to the channel coding problem the optimal rate of the codebook with respect to the blocklength is given by a convex optimization problem involving information theoretic quantities like mutual information. The value of the rate in dependence of the distortion level as well as the optimizer used in the codebook construction are of theoretical and practical importance in communication and information theory. In this paper the behavior of the rate distortion function regarding the computability of the optimizing test channel is investigated. We find that comparable with known results about the optimizer for other information theoretic problems a similar result is found to be true also regarding the computability of the optimizer for rate distortion functions.
  It turns out that while the rate distortion function is usually computable the optimizer for this problem is in general non-computable even for simple distortion measures.

### [140] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，使用LLM和AMR图来自动生成解决逻辑谜题的完整ASP程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多不熟悉编程语言的人需要与代码交互，开发一种让非程序员也能描述和解决组合逻辑问题的方法变得日益重要。ASP虽然强大但存在学习门槛。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词并生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化后的语言，系统性地生成ASP约束规则，从而构建完整的ASP程序。

Result: 系统成功创建了能够解决组合逻辑问题的完整ASP程序，相比完全依赖LLM的方法，本系统将LLM的作用最小化，只用于完成简单任务。

Conclusion: 该方法是从自然语言转换为复杂逻辑问题解决的轻量级、可解释系统的重大第一步，展示了在保持系统可解释性的同时实现自然语言到ASP程序转换的可行性。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Vector Symbolic Algebras的认知合理ARC-AGI求解器，结合System 1直觉和System 2推理，实现了高效可解释的神经符号方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI是人类轻松解决但对AI系统极其困难的基准测试，受神经科学和心理学启发，开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 集成System 1直觉和System 2推理的神经符号方法，基于Vector Symbolic Algebras实现以物体为中心的程序合成。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train和ARC-AGI-1-Eval分别获得10.8%和3.0%的分数，在简化基准Sort-of-ARC和1D-ARC分别获得94.5%和83.1%的成绩，远超GPT-4但计算成本极低。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSAs应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，表现出色且计算高效。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

### [142] [UCO: A Multi-Turn Interactive Reinforcement Learning Method for Adaptive Teaching with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08873)
*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Kun Kuang,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该文提出UCO（单向认知优化）方法解决现有LLMs教学中的局限性，通过双向奖励函数实现动态适应教学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在教学应用中缺乏动态适应能力，无法感知学生的认知状态变化，仅基于答案正确性评估教学效果，无法区分学生是否真正理解。

Method: UCO采用多轮交互式强化学习，设计了Progress Reward和Scaffold Reward两个协同奖励函数。前者评估学生的认知进步，后者动态识别学生的最近发展区（ZPD），确保教学在有效区域内进行。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模的基线模型，并达到与先进闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过认知建模和动态适应机制，有效提升了LLMs在教学场景中的智能水平，为教育AI提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在开放世界环境中像人类一样执行长时间复杂任务的通用智能体，解决现有方法在实时性、任务复杂度和跨环境泛化能力方面的局限。

Method: 基于视觉语言模型的端到端架构，以5Hz处理原始像素输入，生成30Hz键鼠动作，仅在必要时进行自适应推理，在《原神》游戏环境中进行训练。

Conclusion: Lumine在多种3D开放世界和2D GUI任务中表现出色，证明了其在开放环境中的有效性，是向通用智能体迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前生物声学AI系统虽能跨物种识别声音模式，但忽视了AI递归认知与物种递归通信的交互问题，提出应从通用模式识别转向递归认知间的外交式相遇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer和基础模型的生物声学AI系统过度聚焦技术性能，未考虑AI自身递归认知结构可能扭曲其他物种通信本质的双重偶然性问题。

Method: 借由哲学家许煜的递归性理论，分析AI递归机制（注意力、迭代处理）与物种递归通信的互动，提出外交式相遇的重构框架。

Result: 发现AI非中立模式检测器，其架构和训练条件的偶然性会系统性遮蔽物种通信结构，需重新设计模型评估方法。

Conclusion: 生物声学AI应转向不同递归认知形式间的外交范式，在模型设计、评估框架和研究方法中纳入双重偶然性考量。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaCast: 一个重新定义时间序列预测为交互式过程的人机协同推理框架，通过人类智慧与大语言模型的分步协作，在自动预测准备和生成推理优化两个阶段中提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性能力，限制了在复杂实际环境中的实用性。作者旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出AlphaCast框架，包含两个阶段：自动预测准备（构建多源认知基础）和生成推理与反思优化（集成统计特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环）。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测精度上持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人机协同推理框架成功将预测转变为交互式过程，显著提升了预测性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

### [147] [AI Founding Fathers: A Case Study of GIS Search in Multi-Agent Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09005)
*Alvin Chauhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过结构化多智能体管道实现渐进式、增量式、顺序式（GIS）搜索来增强大语言模型的推理能力，并验证了递归精炼（RR）方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在流畅性方面表现出色，但研究者们仍在努力提升其推理能力。本文基于搜索导向的LLM计算理解，旨在系统化地提升LLM的推理和优化能力。

Method: 设计了实验比较简单线性管道与包含递归精炼层的复杂结构化管道。多智能体模型基于美国三位开国元首（汉密尔顿、杰斐逊、麦迪逊）的历史人物设定，使用RAG增强的语料库，针对三个当代政治议题生成回答。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理能力的有效架构特征，高质量推理是受控的、渐进的搜索过程。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Conclusion: Argus框架能有效提高自动驾驶系统的安全性和性能，证明了其在复杂驾驶场景中维持稳健驾驶行为的重要性，为端到端自动驾驶系统的实际部署提供了有价值的弹性增强方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的优化建模方法需要大量标注或合成数据，导致成本高昂且可扩展性差。本文旨在开发一种数据效率更高的自动化优化建模和求解方法，降低专业门槛。

Method: OR-R1框架包含两个阶段：1）监督微调（SFT）从有限标注数据中学习问题表述和代码生成的推理模式；2）测试时组相对策略优化（TGRPO）进一步提能和一致性。这种设计能够同时利用稀缺标注数据和丰富无标签数据进行有效学习。

Conclusion: OR-R1提供了一个稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，显著降低了工业运筹学应用的专业知识和数据障碍，为实现自动化优化建模和求解提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 所提方法从理论上证明具有方差减少和改进收敛性的优势，实际实验验证了其有效性和token效率，为解决大推理模型的过度思考问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

### [154] [MedFuse: Multiplicative Embedding Fusion For Irregular Clinical Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09247)
*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MedFuse框架，通过乘法融合模块(MuFuse)改进临床时间序列数据处理，能够更好地捕捉价值相关的特征相互作用，在三个真实世界数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列数据存在不规律性（异步采样、缺失值、异质特征动态），当前嵌入策略通过加性操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉价值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse（乘法嵌入融合）模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在涵盖重症监护和慢性护理的三个真实数据集上，MedFuse在关键预测任务上持续优于最先进的基线方法。学习的表征分析显示乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse成为了建模不规则临床时间序列的通用化方法，乘法融合机制显著提升了模型的表达能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

### [155] [HyperD: Hybrid Periodicity Decoupling Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09275)
*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为HyperD的新型交通预测框架，通过将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差两个组件，来解决复杂的空间依赖性和多层次周期性模式的交通预测挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临两个主要挑战：复杂的空间依赖关系（道路段和传感器之间的动态交互）以及多层次周期性模式（如日常和周度周期）与由不可预测事件引起的不规则波动的共存问题。为解决这些问题，需要一种能够有效分离和处理不同模式的方法。

Method: HyperD框架将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差两个组件。周期性组件由混合周期性表示模块处理，使用可学习的周期性嵌入和时空注意力提取细粒度的日常和周度模式。残差组件由频率感知残差表示模块处理，在频域中使用复数MLP建模非周期性高频波动。还引入双视角对齐损失来强制两组件的语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的广泛实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时在扰动下展现出卓越的鲁棒性，并且相比现有方法具有更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD框架通过有效解耦交通数据的周期性和非周期性成分，显著提升了交通预测的性能，证明了该方法在处理复杂时空依赖关系和多尺度模式方面的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

### [156] [From Model Training to Model Raising - A call to reform AI model training paradigms from post-hoc alignment to intrinsic, identity-based development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09287)
*Roland Aydin,Christian Cyron,Steve Bachelor,Ashton Anderson,Robert West*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培育"的新范式，将价值观对齐融入模型开发的起始阶段，通过重新设计训练语料库来实现价值观的早期内在嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值观对齐，导致模型容易被误导且缺乏深层价值体系。在大语言模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练范式。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库的四个关键组件：以第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新语境化为生活经验、模拟社交互动、以及搭建训练数据排序的支架结构。

Result: 预期通过这种新的训练语料设计，模型从第一个训练标记开始就建立价值观承诺，使知识、技能和价值观本质上更难分离。

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力超越人类的环境下，将价值观对齐融入模型开发起点的"模型培育"范式具有关键必要性，能够确保AI系统拥有深度植根的价值体系。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

### [157] [Not Everything That Counts Can Be Counted: A Case for Safe Qualitative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09325)
*Stine Beltoft,Lukas Galke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出人工智能（尤其是大语言模型）在定量研究中取得显著进展，但在定性研究方法中应用滞后。研究者被迫使用通用AI工具如ChatGPT处理定性数据，但这些工具存在偏见、不透明等问题。作者呼吁开发专门用于定性研究的透明、可重复且保护隐私的AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AI系统主要服务于定量研究，而定性研究的独特需求（如解释性分析、意义建构）被忽视。定性研究者只能使用通用AI工具，但这些工具不符合定性研究对透明度、可重复性和隐私保护的要求，造成研究方法的不平衡发展。

Method: 作者通过文献回顾分析现有自动化发现流程，识别出可以增强定性研究能力的关键机会。提出了开发专门针对定性研究的AI系统的框架要求，强调透明度、可重复性和隐私友好性。

Result: 分析发现现有的AI科学发现流程缺乏对定性维度的有效整合。识别了安全可靠的定性AI系统在多学科和混合方法研究中的关键应用机会。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发专门为定性研究设计的基础AI系统，这些系统必须满足透明、可重复和隐私保护的要求，以弥补当前AI在定量和定性研究方法整合上的差距，促进更全面的科学理解。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

### [158] [The 2025 Planning Performance of Frontier Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09378)
*Augusto B. Corrêa,André G. Pereira,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种前沿大语言模型在PDDL规划任务上的表现，结果显示GPT-5在标准PDDL领域与LAMA规划器表现相当，但在混淆测试中模型性能有所下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿大语言模型的推理能力，特别是端到端规划性能，并与专业规划器进行对比，了解当前LLMs在规划任务上的实际能力。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习赛道中的PDDL领域和任务描述，对DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5以及LAMA规划器进行对比评估，包括标准PDDL和混淆PDDL两种测试场景。

Result: 在标准PDDL领域，GPT-5的解决任务能力与LAMA规划器相当；在混淆PDDL测试中所有LLMs性能下降，但下降程度比之前报告的模型要小。

Conclusion: 研究显示最新LLMs在规划能力方面相比前几代有显著提升，与专业规划器之间的性能差距在缩小，表明LLMs的推理能力在持续进步。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

*Brian Rogers,Micah Bowles,Chris J. Lintott,Steve Croft*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于潜流匹配和分类器自由引导的新方法，通过显式分离条件信息和残差表示来解耦潜在子空间。该方法能够获取高维数据的有意义特征，为分析和重用潜在表示提供了简单而强大的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学发现中，访问学习表示中的关键信息对于高维领域至关重要。现有的方法往往难以有效分离和访问潜在表示中的特定信息。

Method: 基于潜流匹配和分类器自由引导的新方法，通过显式分离条件信息和残差表示来实现潜在子空间的解耦。

Result: 在三个实验（合成2D高斯玩具问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文数据集）中，该方法成功获取了高维数据的有意义特征，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单而强大的机制，用于分析、控制和重用潜在表示，为使用生成模型进行科学探索提供了新途径，特别是在处理未捕获、考虑或分类的信息方面。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

### [160] [CrochetBench: Can Vision-Language Models Move from Describing to Doing in Crochet Domain?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09483)
*Peiyu Li,Xiaobao Huang,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CrochetBench这一基准，旨在评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域中执行细粒度、低层程序化推理的能力，强调从描述转向实际操作（识别针法、选择指令、生成可执行程序），并通过DSL实现结构化验证和执行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准多关注高层描述或视觉问答，而CrochetBench希望填补从表面理解到可执行精确度的差距，特别是在真实世界的创意领域，挑战模型的结构化符号推理和3D感知的程序合成能力。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和功能评估；基准任务包括针法分类、指令接地、自然语言/图像到DSL的翻译；通过执行正确性（而非表面相似性）来衡量性能。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能显著下降，暴露了长程符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为多模态模型的程序能力评估提供了新视角，并凸显了在真实创意领域中表面理解与可执行精确度之间的差距；代码已开源。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

### [161] [Consensus Sampling for Safer Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09493)
*Adam Tauman Kalai,Yael Tauman Kalai,Or Zamir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过聚合多个生成模型来增强AI安全性的架构无关方法，使聚合模型继承给定规模最安全子集的安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多AI安全方法依赖于检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险仅通过检查无法检测。需要一种互补方法来解决这种局限性

Method: 使用共识采样算法，给定k个模型和提示，实现在给定大小的最安全s个模型中的平均风险水平，当模型间缺乏足够一致性时选择弃权

Result: 该方法能够将集合中未知子模型的安全性保证放大到单个可靠模型的水平，但前提是安全模型之间存在足够重叠

Conclusion: 这种基于模型聚合的方法为AI安全提供了一种新的模型无关途径，通过放大安全保证来增强整体安全性

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

### [162] [Fundamentals of Physical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09497)
*Vahid Salehi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了物理人工智能（Physical AI）的六个基本原则，将智能视为身体、环境和经验之间真实互动的涌现现象，与传统AI的符号处理和数据分析模型形成鲜明对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为智能系统的物理体现、感官感知、行动能力、学习过程和上下文敏感性建立统一的理论基础，将智能理解为物理实现的交互过程而非抽象计算。

Method: 提出了物理AI的六个基本要素理论框架（具身化、感官感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和上下文敏感性），并通过康复诊所中协助患者的自适应机器人的实际案例进行说明。

Result: 证明了这六个原则不是松散的功能模块，而是构成一个闭环控制系统，其中能量、信息、控制和上下文持续互动，使系统能够从物理体验而非数据库生成意义。

Conclusion: 物理AI代表了一种范式转变，将智能视为物理具身过程，学习被理解为智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，而非参数调整。这种基于物理体验的智能能够实现更自然和有效的交互。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Motivation: 提高5G铁路系统的可靠性，通过早期预测无线链路故障来支持主动控制措施（如冗余和自适应切换）

Method: 使用10Hz地铁列车轨迹数据（包括服务小区和邻小区指标），对比测试CNN、LSTM、XGBoost、Anomaly Transformer、PatchTST和TimesNet六种模型在不同观察窗口和预测时间窗口下的性能

Result: TimesNet在3秒观察窗口和3秒预测窗口下获得最高F1分数；CNN在3秒观察窗口和2秒预测窗口下提供良好的准确性和延迟平衡

Conclusion: 深度时序模型能够使用商用设备上的轻量级特征提前几秒预测可靠性下降，为5G铁路系统提供了实用的早期预警控制路径

Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries by connecting billions of devices to collect, process, and share data. However, the massive data volumes and real-time demands of IoT applications strain traditional cloud computing architectures. This paper explores the complementary roles of cloud, fog, and edge computing in enhancing IoT performance, focusing on their ability to reduce latency, improve scalability, and ensure data privacy. We propose a novel framework, the Hierarchical IoT Processing Architecture (HIPA), which dynamically allocates computational tasks across cloud, fog, and edge layers using machine learning. By synthesizing current research and introducing HIPA, this paper highlights how these paradigms can create efficient, secure, and scalable IoT ecosystems.

Abstract: The trade-off between energy and latency budgets is becoming significant due to the more stringent QoS requirements in 6G vehicular networks. However, comprehensively studying the trade-off between energy and latency budgets for 6G vehicular network with new Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) features is still under-explored. This paper proposes a novel multi-hop, multi-path vehicular networking that jointly optimizes vehicular traffic splitting across candidate routes and per-link transmit power to achieve low-latency and low-power communications. Afterwards, we formalize two complementary problem formulations (minimum latency and minimum power) based on the proposed 6G V2X architecture and provide sufficient conditions. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via well-designed simulations. Based on these theories, we design algorithm (LLP MHMP Scheduler) that switches on demand between a fixed-power minimum-latency mode and a fixed-latency minimum-power mode.
