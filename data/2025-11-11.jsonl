We further obtain a simple closed-form relation linking the\nachievable antenna savings to the inter-module separation while preserving the\nsame transverse accuracy of a uniform linear array (ULA). We further\ninvestigate how velocity mismatch affects array gain and show that\ntransverse-velocity errors cause more severe performance degradation than\nradial-velocity errors.

This thesis\nexplores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization\nabilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help\nsystematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious\nplanning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which\nallows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the\nmost relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous\nintentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach\nsignificantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks.\nSubsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper\nframework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more\nmanageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts\nand efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent\nspatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a\ncommon failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative\nmodels to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most\nagents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional\nplanning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional\nintentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting\nhallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance\nimprovements in various kinds of planning agents.

However, two major challenges remain:\ni)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and\nii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called\nUrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text\nawareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an\ninformation-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long\ncaptions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To\neffectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we\npropose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model\ncollaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions\nwithout human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based\nself-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating\nrobust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments\nacross four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our UrbanLN."}

To\naddress this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system\nlog-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of\ngeneral and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without\nany labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router\nbased on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs\ninto 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs\na small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct\ntraining and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between\nthe source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate\npseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative\nknowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small\nmodel (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to\nthe target system.

RL then follows a two-stage\nprocess with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large,\nuniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively\nshort response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage)\nto expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform\n\\textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging\nproblems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a\nhard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances\nthroughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on\nLeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and\nis comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking.\nWe also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal\nlarge-scale MoE model. Our study distills concise best practices for data\ncuration, entropy expansion, and curriculum design in RLVR for\ncompetitive-programming code generation."}

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\nmethods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in\ncontinual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often\nleads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating\ndistinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear\ngrowth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between\nrelated tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT\nmethod referred to as \\textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel\ncontinual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient\nscalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the\ntransformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This\narchitecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated\nSubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic\nforgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously\nlearned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer\nwhile ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs\non the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that\nMoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in\nboth knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings."}

Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most\nefficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates\nattention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate\nuseful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian\nAttention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores\nover UniZero. These findings suggest that in partially observable RL domains\nwith non-stationary temporal dependencies, discrete memory windows are\ndifficult to learn reliably, whereas smooth distributional priors flexibly\nadapt across horizons and yield more robust data efficiency. Overall, our\nresults demonstrate that encoding structured temporal priors directly into\nself-attention improves the prioritization of informative histories for\ndynamics modeling under partial observability."}

We further\nstudy the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits\n\\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes\nglobal collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms\nthat encourage \\emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1)\n$\\beta$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck,\npromoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large;\n(2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions,\nwhich can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also\nintroduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global\nconsistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with\nitem embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal\nsharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix,\nMovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our\nproposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful\nonline experiment."}

More specifically,\nwe consider multiple ground base stations (GBSs) and each GBS has three\ndifferent sectors/cells in the terrestrial networks, and multiple cells are\nturned off due to NES or incidents, e.g., disasters, hardware failures, or\noutages. To address this, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (MADDPG) framework to enable UAV-assisted communication by jointly\noptimizing UAV trajectories, transmission power, and user-UAV association under\na sleeping ground base station (GBS) strategy. This framework aims to ensure\nthe resilience of active users in the network and the long-term operability of\nUAVs. Specifically, it maximizes service coverage for users during power\noutages or NES zones, while minimizing the energy consumption of UAVs.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG policy consistently\nachieves high coverage ratio across different testing episodes, outperforming\nother baselines. Moreover, the MADDPG framework attains the lowest total energy\nconsumption, with a reduction of approximately 24\\% compared to the\nconventional all GBS ON configuration, while maintaining a comparable user\nservice rate. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nin achieving a superior trade-off between energy efficiency and service\nperformance, supporting the development of sustainable and resilient\nUAV-assisted cellular networks."}

To accelerate this\ntransformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality\ndatasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and\nrobust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly\nenhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale,\nhigh-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control\nagents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured\ninteractions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive\nexploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal\ncomplexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating\nmobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the\ncommonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile\ncontrol agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols\nand AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our\ncontributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control\nagents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device\ninteractions."}
