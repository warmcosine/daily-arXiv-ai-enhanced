As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u632f\u8361\u7684\u8d77\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u8fbe98%\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u5236\u632f\u8361\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fee\u526a\u7cbe\u786e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\uff08PELT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6700\u5c0fFO\u6bb5\u957f\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528minniWECC\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4e\u9636ARMAX\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5236\u632f\u8361\u7684\u8d77\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u7684PELT\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f3a\u5236\u632f\u8361\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u7535\u6a21\u5f0f\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCNN-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684EEG\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u591a\u6587\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8691%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4ec5\u97005\u4e2a\u7535\u6781\u5373\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u6216\u8bed\u97f3\u7ebf\u7d22\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7EEG\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5bb6\u60c5\u7eea\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CNN-Transformer\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SEED\u3001SEED-FRA\u548cSEED-GER\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u6570\u636e\uff081,455\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5c0662\u4e2a\u7535\u6781\u51cf\u5c11\u52305\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7535\u6781\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eSVM\u3001DNN\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec5\u75285\u4e2a\u7535\u6781\u533a\u5206\u79ef\u6781\u3001\u4e2d\u7acb\u548c\u6d88\u6781\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u7535\u6781\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u5065\u5eb7\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u88ab\u52a8\u60c5\u7eea\u76d1\u6d4b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6216\u62a4\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u7d22\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5"}}

In Bangladesh, recurring floods severely hinder communication systems, isolating affected populations and obstructing emergency response efforts. To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for intelligent and adaptive routing solutions capable of sustaining critical communication and services without relying on fixed infrastructure. This research presents AZIZA (Adaptive Zone-based Intelligent Fully Distributed Trust-Aware Routing Protocol), a next-generation opportunistic protocol designed to improve the resiliency of critical communication and services in disaster-prone and flood-affected regions. AZIZA supports adaptive data delivery for emergency alerts, sensor readings, and inter-zone coordination by integrating (1) zone-based forwarding to optimize localized transmission, (2) trust-aware logic to bypass uncooperative or malicious nodes, and (3) context-driven decision-making based on trust metrics, residual energy, and historical delivery patterns. AZIZA operates over lightweight, infrastructure-less edge ad hoc networks comprising mobile phones, UAVs, and ground vehicles acting as decentralized service relays. Simulation results using The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator configured with real-world mobility traces and flood data from Bangladesh demonstrate that AZIZA significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in delivery reliability, energy efficiency, and routing resilience.

This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u4f53\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08FRIS\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5019\u9009\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5143\u4ef6\u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6eRIS\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08RIS\uff09\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u5143\u4ef6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002FRIS\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5143\u4ef6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff08AO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u4f18\u6c42\u89e3\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u4f18\u5316\uff08CEO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8054\u5408\u5143\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FRIS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u4ef6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u914d\u7f6e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "FRIS\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5143\u4ef6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance.

By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization.

While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.\n  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.\n  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5fae\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fc1\u79fb\u6765\u5339\u914d\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4f9b\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0a\u51e0\u4e4e\u603b\u662f\u5408\u7406\u7684\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u4ee5\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u683c\u5c40\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5173\u8054\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u5e7f\u57df\u7f51\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7a97\u53e3\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8fc1\u79fb\u4ece\u6700\u4f73\u6548\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f16\u6392\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u975e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u7eaf\u7cb9\u80fd\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8fc1\u79fb\u662f\u672a\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u6267\u884c\u53d8\u5f97\u6d41\u52a8\u3001\u5730\u7406\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u4e0e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Developing a method to remove such complex noise and reconstruct high-fidelity signals is clinically valuable for diagnostic accuracy. However, denoising of multi-beat ECG segments remains understudied and poses technical challenges. To address this, we propose Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion (TFCDiff), a novel approach that operates in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and uses the DCT coefficients of noisy signals as conditioning input. To refine waveform details, we incorporate Temporal Feature Enhancement Mechanism (TFEM) to reinforce temporal representations and preserve key physiological information. Comparative experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate that TFCDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, TFCDiff shows superior generalization on the unseen SimEMG Database, outperforming all benchmark models. Notably, TFCDiff processes raw 10-second sequences and maintains robustness under flexible random mixed noise (fRMN), enabling plug-and-play deployment in wearable ECG monitors for high-motion scenarios.
