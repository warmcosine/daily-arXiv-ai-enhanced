### [1] [Rapid and Accurate Changepoint Detection of Power System Forced Oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15812)
*Luke Dosiek,Akaash Karn,Frank Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的时变点检测方法，用于估计电力系统数据中强制振荡的起止时间。该方法通过手动设置惩罚参数而非自动调优，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算时间达98%，并减少了输入参数需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时变点检测方法在应用于电力系统强制振荡检测时存在计算复杂度高和参数设置复杂的问题。本文旨在开发一种更高效、参数更少的检测算法。

Method: 使用修剪精确线性时间（PELT）算法，但不同于传统自动调优惩罚参数的方式，提出手动设置惩罚参数的方法。该方法减少了输入参数数量，并提供数据驱动的最小FO段长度设置方法。使用minniWECC模型的低阶ARMAX表示进行测试。

Result: 新方法实现了98%的计算时间减少，同时保持了高估计精度。算法在检测强制振荡的起止时间方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 所提出的手动设置惩罚参数的PELT算法是一种高效、准确的强制振荡检测方法，显著提升了计算效率，为机电模式计提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统情绪识别方法在面部表情或语音线索受限场景下的不足，为心理健康诊断和干预提供更可行的技术方案，同时探索利用低成本消费级EEG设备实现在家情绪监测的可能性

Method: 采用CNN-Transformer混合架构处理EEG信号，使用SEED、SEED-FRA和SEED-GER三个数据集的合并数据（1,455个样本），将62个电极减少到5个核心电极进行情绪分类

Abstract: An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder that is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. While existing diagnostic approaches can roughly classify OSA severity or detect isolated respiratory events, they lack the precision and comprehensiveness required for high resolution, event level diagnosis. Here, we present UT OSANet, a deep learning based model designed as a event level, multi scenario diagnostic tool for OSA. This model facilitates detailed identification of events associated with OSA, including apnea, hypopnea, oxygen desaturation, and arousal. Moreover, the model employs flexibly adjustable input modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG), airflow, and SpO 2. It utilizes a random masked modality combination training strategy, allowing it to comprehend cross-modal relationships while sustaining consistent performance across varying modality conditions. This model was trained and evaluated utilizing 9,021 polysomnography (PSG) recordings from five independent datasets. achieving sensitivities up to 0.93 and macro F1 scores of 0.84, 0.85 across home, clinical, and research scenarios. This model serves as an event-level, multi-scenario diagnostic instrument for real-world applications of OSA, while also establishing itself as a means to deepen the mechanistic comprehension of respiratory processes in sleep disorders and their extensive health implications.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance. Drawing inspiration from this methodology, we conduct a systematic study in this work on the design principles, equivalent modeling, and precoding strategies for low-complexity multiplexed Rydberg array, an endeavor crucial to enabling practical and scalable quantum-enhanced communication systems.

Abstract: We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.

Conclusion: 该紧耦合天线设计有效证明了通过叶片重叠增强互耦合的方法可以显著改善双极化维瓦尔第天线的低频性能，为宽带天线系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Very wideband apertures are needed in positioning, sensing, spectrum monitoring, and modern spread spectrum, e.g., frequency hopping systems. Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.

### [7] [TFCDiff: Robust ECG Denoising via Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16627)

Main category: eess.SP

Result: 在合成数据集上，TFCDiff在五项评估指标上达到最先进性能，在未见过的SimEMG数据库上表现出优越泛化能力，优于所有基准模型。

Conclusion: TFCDiff能处理原始10秒序列并在灵活随机混合噪声下保持鲁棒性，可在可穿戴心电监测器中实现即插即用部署，适用于高运动场景。

Abstract: Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) readings are prone to mixed noise from physical activities, including baseline wander (BW), muscle artifact (MA), and electrode motion artifact (EM). Developing a method to remove such complex noise and reconstruct high-fidelity signals is clinically valuable for diagnostic accuracy. However, denoising of multi-beat ECG segments remains understudied and poses technical challenges. To address this, we propose Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion (TFCDiff), a novel approach that operates in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and uses the DCT coefficients of noisy signals as conditioning input. To refine waveform details, we incorporate Temporal Feature Enhancement Mechanism (TFEM) to reinforce temporal representations and preserve key physiological information. Comparative experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate that TFCDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, TFCDiff shows superior generalization on the unseen SimEMG Database, outperforming all benchmark models. Notably, TFCDiff processes raw 10-second sequences and maintains robustness under flexible random mixed noise (fRMN), enabling plug-and-play deployment in wearable ECG monitors for high-motion scenarios.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了AZIZA协议，一种用于灾区和洪水灾区的新型机会路由协议，通过区域转发、信任感知和上下文驱动决策来提升灾难环境下的通信韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国频繁的洪水灾害破坏通信系统，隔离受灾人口并阻碍应急响应，需要不依赖固定基础设施的自适应路由解决方案。

Method: AZIZA协议整合了三项关键技术：(1)基于区域的转发优化局部传输，(2)信任感知逻辑绕过不合作节点，(3)基于信任指标、剩余能量和历史交付模式的上下文驱动决策。

Result: 使用ONE模拟器和孟加拉国真实移动轨迹及洪水数据的仿真结果表明，AZIZA在交付可靠性、能效和路由韧性方面显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: AZIZA作为可扩展的部署框架，推动了在传统系统经常崩溃环境中下一代机会路由的应用。

Abstract: Opportunistic routing architectures offer a resilient communication paradigm in environments where conventional networks fail due to disrupted infrastructure, dynamic node mobility, and intermittent connectivity conditions that commonly arise during large-scale disasters. In Bangladesh, recurring floods severely hinder communication systems, isolating affected populations and obstructing emergency response efforts. To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for intelligent and adaptive routing solutions capable of sustaining critical communication and services without relying on fixed infrastructure. This research presents AZIZA (Adaptive Zone-based Intelligent Fully Distributed Trust-Aware Routing Protocol), a next-generation opportunistic protocol designed to improve the resiliency of critical communication and services in disaster-prone and flood-affected regions. AZIZA supports adaptive data delivery for emergency alerts, sensor readings, and inter-zone coordination by integrating (1) zone-based forwarding to optimize localized transmission, (2) trust-aware logic to bypass uncooperative or malicious nodes, and (3) context-driven decision-making based on trust metrics, residual energy, and historical delivery patterns. AZIZA operates over lightweight, infrastructure-less edge ad hoc networks comprising mobile phones, UAVs, and ground vehicles acting as decentralized service relays. Simulation results using The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator configured with real-world mobility traces and flood data from Bangladesh demonstrate that AZIZA significantly outperforms benchmark approaches in delivery reliability, energy efficiency, and routing resilience. As a scalable and deployable framework, AZIZA advances the use of next-generation opportunistic routing in environments where traditional systems routinely collapse.

### [9] [Green Distributed AI Training: Orchestrating Compute Across Renewable-Powered Micro Datacenters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16182)

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于可再生能源的分布式微数据中心架构，通过动态工作负载迁移来匹配间歇性可再生能源供应。研究建立了正式的可行性领域模型，揭示了迁移在能量上几乎总是合理的，主要约束是时间而非能量。

Conclusion: 可行性感知迁移是未来计算范式的基础构建块，使AI执行变得流动、地理自适应并与可再生能源可用性相一致。

Abstract: The accelerating expansion of AI workloads is colliding with an energy landscape increasingly dominated by intermittent renewable generation. While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration.
  At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies.
  Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.

### [10] [Payment-failure times for random Lightning paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16376)
*Taki E. M. Abedesselam,Fabio Giacomelli,Francesco Pasquale,Michele Salvi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper studies a random process modeling Bitcoin Lightning Network payment failures, proves time bounds for complete graphs based on network size and edge capacities, relates the process to edge-betweenness centrality, establishes bounds for arbitrary graphs, and validates results with simulations including real Lightning Network data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by payment execution in Bitcoin's Lightning Network, the research aims to understand and quantify the time until payment failures occur in such layer-two solutions.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis (proving upper and lower bounds for complete graphs and arbitrary graphs using edge-betweenness centrality) with extensive simulations on various graph classes, including real Lightning Network snapshots.

Result: The paper establishes nearly tight bounds on payment failure times for complete graphs as a function of nodes and edge capacities, demonstrates the relationship with edge-betweenness centrality, and provides bounds for arbitrary graphs, all validated through simulations.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical foundations and practical validation for understanding payment failure dynamics in Lightning Network-like systems, linking network topology (via edge-betweenness centrality) and capacity constraints to failure timing.

Abstract: We study a random process over graphs inspired by the way payments are executed in the Lightning Network, the main layer-two solution on top of Bitcoin. We first prove almost tight upper and lower bounds on the time it takes for a payment failure to occur, as a function of the number of nodes and the edge capacities, when the underlying graph is complete. Then, we show how such a random process is related to the edge-betweenness centrality measure and we prove upper and lower bounds for arbitrary graphs as a function of edge-betweenness and capacity. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by running extensive simulations over some classes of graphs, including snapshots of the real Lightning Network.

### [11] [Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (FRIS) Enabling Secure Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15860)
*Xusheng Zhu,Kai-Kit Wong,Boyi Tang,Wen Chen,Chan-Byoung Chae*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出流体可重构智能表面（FRIS）概念，通过动态选择候选位置上最佳的反射元件子集来增强物理层安全，相比传统固定位置RIS具有更大自由度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可重构智能表面（RIS）的反射元件位置固定，限制了性能优化空间。FRIS通过增加元件位置可重构性这一新自由度，旨在显著提升通信系统的物理层安全性能。

Conclusion: FRIS通过引入元件位置可重构性这一新自由度，为物理层安全提供了实质性改进，解决了传统RIS因固定位置带来的性能限制问题。

Abstract: The concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) upgrades the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm by empowering its reflecting elements with positioning reconfigurability. This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).
